Browserifyâ€™s [urify-emitter](https://github.com/mattdesl/urify-emitter) plugin emits files into the specified directory and replaces references to that file with the path of the emitted file. An additional gulp task can be used to minify the CSS using [gulp-clean-css](https://github.com/scniro/gulp-clean-css).
