title: Inlining scripts
shortDesc: 'Can processed scripts be inlined into HTML?'
---

# Introduction

There are a number of cases where small amounts of JavaScript are most effectively delivered inline in an HTML page. Some common examples are analytics code that needs to run early on during page loading, or [hashed URL mappings](/hashing/avoid-cascade/) that can't be cached. In these cases, it's often useful or even required that the JavaScript is generated by a build tool, which means that tool must also provide a way to inline the code into HTML documents.

# The Test

This test emulates a minimal two-page website, with "index" and "profile" pages. Each page has its own script, but the two depend on a common library and also each lazily import a second shared module, creating a [split point](/code-splitting/dynamic-import/). Building the pages should bundle and inline the scripts for `index.html`, but preserve the scripts from `profile.html` as well as the lazy-loaded module.

**index.js**

```js
import { logCaps } from './utils.js';
import { exclaim } from './exclaim.js';
logCaps(exclaim('This is index'));
import('./lazy.js');
```

**exclaim.js**

```js
export function exclaim(msg) {
  return msg + '!';
}
```

**profile.js**

```js
import { logCaps } from './utils.js';
logCaps('This is profile');
import('./lazy.js');
```

**utils.js**

```js
export function logCaps(msg) {
  console.log(msg.toUpperCase());
}
```

**lazy.js**

```js
console.log('Totally lazy');
```

The build result should be include two HTML files. `index.html` should contain inlinined bundle for `index.js` and its dependencies. `profile.html` should reference the bundle for `profile.js` as an external script. Both pages should reference the same lazy-loaded bundle for `lazy.js`.
