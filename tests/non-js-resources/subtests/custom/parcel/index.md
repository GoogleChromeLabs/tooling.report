Parcel fails on importing unknown file extension, lamenting the lack of a “transformer”. There is a [plugin infrastructure for Parcel 2](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/tree/bb5ad3d1adaebb42514750b12d8f7470d66a7bd9) that lets me write my own transformers, but at the time of writing, the documentation doesn’t really tell me _how_.
