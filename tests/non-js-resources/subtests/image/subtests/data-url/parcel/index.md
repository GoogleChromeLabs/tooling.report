Parcel supports this out-of-the box via an [import with a special scheme](<https://v2.parceljs.org/configuration/plugin-configuration/#predefined-(offical)-named-pipelines>), `data-url:`.

This only works with JavaScript imports. If you try and use it in HTML: `<img src="data-url:./img.png">`, the src is replaced with an internal identifier. However, this isn't required to pass the test.
