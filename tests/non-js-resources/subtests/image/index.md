title: Images
shortDesc: 'Import images from JavaScript'
---

Most web projects need images of some form. Bringing assets like images into the JavaScript module graph is beneficial because it allows their usage to be tracked the same way module dependencies are tracked. The standard representation of images imported from JavaScript is the URL: either a URL reference to an image asset, or a [data URL] containing the encoded image inline.
