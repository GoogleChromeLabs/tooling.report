title: Supports Export Maps
---

Are [Conditional Export Maps](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_conditional_exports) respected when loading modules?

Export Maps was introduced in Node 13, and has already been adopted by modules like [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/1613418f9b25e56aa511a06f0b0e3c1856f05737/packages/babel-compat-data/package.json#L11-L17) and [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/0da80052df34bb6528c07d37629f600001838c3a/package.json#L12-L48).
