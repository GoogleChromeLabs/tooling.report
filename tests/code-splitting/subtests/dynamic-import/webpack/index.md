Webpack was one of the first bundlers to use [Dynamic Imports] as a signal for creating code-splitting boundaries.

Unlike [multiple entries](/code-splitting/multi-entry/), split points created using [Dynamic Imports] consistently result in a separate bundle being created without customizing `optimization.splitChunks`.
