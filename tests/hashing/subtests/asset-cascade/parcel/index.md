Parcel supports importing raw assets to obtain their hashed URLs out-of-the box via an [import with a special scheme](<https://v2.parceljs.org/configuration/plugin-configuration/#predefined-(offical)-named-pipelines>), `url:`.

Changes to assets correctly cause the hash of the bundle with the asset reference to change.
